At least 28 people were killed in this complex attack and 54 injured. Among those killed were SNG officials and an INGO national staff. Two INGO staffs were also injured in the attack. Al Shabaab immediately claimed responsibility for the attack and described it as ""a major operation in Mogadishu against the apostate officials"" through the pro-al Shabaab Radio Andulus and Somalimemo website.
